            Hello, my name is Cristiano Alves! I’m a full-time professional in the natural stone industry and a lifelong
            learner with a deep curiosity for how things work—both in the physical world and in the human spirit. I’m
            currently pursuing a Computer Science degree through BYU-Pathway Worldwide, and I’m excited about how
            technology can be used to create, connect, and serve others.
        </p>
        <p>
            My faith is a central part of who I am. I believe that life has divine purpose and that we grow through
            seeking truth, serving others, and striving to become a little better each day. My experiences in the Church
            have taught me humility, gratitude, and the joy that comes from helping others find hope.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of work and study, I have a wide range of interests—I love writing, learning new languages,
            exploring different cultures, and studying topics like physics and philosophy. I also enjoy quiet moments
            outdoors, where I can reflect and recharge.
        </p>
        <p>
            In everything I do, I try to live with purpose, stay curious, and build genuine connections with people
            wherever I go.
        </p>
